# Feature Analysis of Wine Costing

## Project Description
This project aims to analyze the features of wines that cost more than 20 euros. The analysis includes big data processing, visualization, and machine learning models to understand the factors influencing wine prices and quality.

## Installation
To run this project, you need to have Python installed along with the following packages:

- numpy
- pandas
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- nltk
- scikit-learn

You can install the required packages using pip:
```bash
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn nltk scikit-learn
```

## Usage
1. Clone the repository or download the notebook `Wine.ipynb`.
2. Ensure you have the required datasets (`winemag-data_first150k.csv` and `winemag-data-130k-v2.csv`) in the same directory as the notebook.
3. Open the notebook and run the cells sequentially to perform the analysis.

## Project Structure
- **Wine.ipynb**: The main notebook containing the analysis.
- **winemag-data_first150k.csv**: The primary dataset for training.
- **winemag-data-130k-v2.csv**: The secondary dataset for testing.
